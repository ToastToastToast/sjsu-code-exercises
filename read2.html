      Q1. Given the Wikipedia definitions on data versus information, what is your own take on this, 
      and specifically describe in your own words what is the difference between data and information?
      <br><br>
      Data is some form that provides information, usually in numbers or characters. 
      Similar to the ideas of visualization and mapping, Data is a subset of information. 
      Data is more targeted toward a collection of something specific while information remains more general. 
      Both provide knowledge but data involves comparing more than one thing. For example, a cup with the word “don’t touch” gives us knowledge about what to do with the cup. 
      However, this isn’t data because there is no numerical meaning represented by the phrase written on the cup. 
      <br><br>
      Q2. From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?
      <br><br>
      Visualization is a subcategory of mapping as mapping is changing a particular file or software into a different format. 
      For example, a mp3 file into an image. Visualization is specifically turning some sort of data that people cannot normally see into a visible representation that humans can see.
       For example, how computers turn a million 0s and 1s into an image of some sort. 
       Another example being Natalie Jeremijenko’s “live wire” project visualizing the activity in a network. 
      <br><br>
      Q3. When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art what is he referring to? Do you agree with this notion?
      <br><br>
      The sublime is the unrepresentable phenomena, particularly in nature during the Romanticism movement that couldn’t be seen or explained. 
      Manovich is saying that data visualization is the opposite because they’re visualizing what is thought to not be possibly seen by the human eye. 
      I somewhat agree with his claim because artists working with data visualization are visualizing something intangible which is opposite of the romanticism idea of sublime. 
      However, romanticism artists did try to represent the sublime in their art if at all possible in their paintings. 
      Specifically John Robert Cozins worked with paintings of the Sublime to try and capture the feeling but is 
      never possible to truly represent the real sublime which is possible with data visualization. 
      The two are conceptually different but approach the idea in a somewhat similar way in my eyes. 
      <br><br>
      Q4. Choose two artists, 1 from group A and 1 from group B, then Watch their videos, check their portfolio, 
      and then write a paragraph summarizing each artist, what they showed in their presentation, and the type of art they make.

      <h5>Aaron Koblin</h5>
      Aaron Koblin is an artist focusing on data visualization and commonly uses crowdsourcing to get the data needed. The data was compiled together for the project. 
      He’s also interested in music and how it affects the way people feel and think. 
      One of his work’s from his presentation wa, “Johnny Cash Project'', where many people draw frames for a music video. 
      Viewers can see the various different frames drawn for each scene of the video and process of the creation of each frame. Another project, 
      “Rome: 3 Dreams of Black” is a webgl music video project. It was playable in the browser in real time that wasn’t possible before without some extra computation. 
      His work has shifted from aesthetically pleasing graphics of data visualization to crowd sourced data, combining both music and imagery for a moving experience.

      <h5>Jennifer Daniel</h5> 
      Jennifer Daniel is an art director who works with emojis and how people express themselves in an online digital environment. 
      She demonstrated how emojis came to be and how different companies have different emojis with varied expressions. 
      She explains how emojis are a form of speaking and not writing as writing is a very conscious task unlike speaking. 
      She’s unhappy with the fact that communication between different brands can lead to the same message actually having 
      different meanings when the sender and receiver are communicating.

      <br><br>
 
      Additional Category: Data as Music
      Aaron Koblin falls under the category because of his work Bicycle Built for Two Thousand. 
      Computer synthezied vocals from over two thousand voices were used to sing the song Daisly Bell. 
      A lot of Koblin’s work utilizes music to spurr more emotion and strengthening the expression in his artworks.
